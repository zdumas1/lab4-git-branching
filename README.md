## Overview

This repo contains a simple "choose your own adventure" style Python story. You will create and explore multiple branches to simulate different versions of this story.

## Your Task

You will:
1. Create two new branches: `hero-path` and `villain-path`
2. Make different story twists in each branch
3. Commit and push all changes to GitHub
4. Write a short summary of each branch here
